## Why UI Frameworks work
UI Frameworks may see like extra work to do when creating an application, however, since web applications have became more and more advanced, the way of building them have to adapt with that. Plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript would just be a pain to work with in the current era of highly technical and elegant UI websites. Therefore, using UI Frameworks such as Bootstrap and React are necessary to getting the job done. Furthermore, these frameworks will also provide structure to allow for ease of collaboration between team members. 

## Bootstrap 5
Bootstrap can create inline HTML style in the form of classes that can be valuable to directly styling your HTML tags. Without bootstrap you would need to assign these stylings within a .css file and sometimes the styling is hard to decipher when another person is looking at your code. Bootstrap you can create all positioning of your elements in the HTML code which allows for easier readability of the code. 

## React
React is a UI Framework that I have been more familiar with since an internship in which I had to use it. React may be difficult to master, however, the ability to create JSX in your website is very useful to create beautiful web applications with all the functionality of other websites. This allows all of your code; HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be incorporated into one file. That is why it makes it one of the most used UI Framework in the world.
