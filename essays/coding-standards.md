## Importance
Coding standards are considered to be tedious and time consume, however, if you were to picture software development in a big picture, it turns out that it is very important to all developers. Since writing code can be considered a art form where not everybody does it the same way yet still getting the same outcome, we can see that there will be numerous amounts of differences between developers. Coding standards are there to align styles so that each developer can read other code with ease. 

## JavaScript and ESLint
By learning JavaScript and learning the language, it can help to use a linter to help you learn the language. By writing well styled code it can allow a developer to learn new things about the language. ESLint is one of those helpers that allow a developer understand where their style can be improved. Ever since I have been using ESLint I can tell how easy the code is to read as well as how easy it is to conform to. Since I have been using this tool as I am learning I am not using any bad habbits throughout my learning process. In today's day and age we can even understand easy it is to abide by these coding standards with the help of the tools we are given. Now a lot of IDE's and text editors can enable these linters and automatically fix your code so that it will abide by ESLint standards. This makes it not only easy to adhere to coding standards but it begs the question: Why wouldn't you use these tools to make your code up to standards?
