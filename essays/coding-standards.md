## Why JavaScript?
I have recently gotten more into JavaScript. Through college I mainly focused on C, C++ and Python. However, I was introduced to the language through a certification where I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and learned more about Front-End web development and used it in the React Framework aswell. So far, I have enjoyed using the language, however, while it does have similar syntax to C, it has the user friendliness of Python. 

## JavaScript use in Software Engineering
The major experience I had learning and using JavaScript was through one of my internships. I was tasked to create UI using React Native. However, the standard for this project was to use TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which allows for static typing of variables. While this may not be exactly JavaScript, in syntax it is almost the same. JavaScript is a very powerful language in which a majority of web applications is created in which makes it an important tool to learn. 

## FreeCodeCamp Intro to JavaScript
This introductory course to JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp is a great resource for people who are new as well as people who are experienced and want to learn more. This course did introduce ES6 which is one of the newer versions of JavaScript where they have different standards of coding. In our ICS 314 course we got to use JavaScript through our Workouts of the day (WODs) and we would do challenges from the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. These practices that are directly from the book are very useful for landing a career and this style of learning of being very active in class is very beneficial to the learning outcomes of students.
