<p>Software Engineering was not always known to me as the career choice I wanted to pursue. It took me a long time to understand what Software Engineers do in their day to day. However, through college and learning through internships, I now know that this career is the one I want to pursue.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-software-development">Open Source Software Development</h2>
<p>A lot of the open source software out there has been the most impactful in the world today. For example, Linux is an open-source software and it is free to use. This means that it is available to many people for all sorts of projects. The open-source nature allows for a huge community to come together and bring all sorts of ideas on how they can contribute to the project. This allows many points of views and new ideas some people may have not thought of to be combined to a great project.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>
<p>Coding standards has been a great and not so great part of development. It has been great to learn all of the specific ways to make your code more readable and cleaner for more people to edit/work on. However, in doing so, it adds more tedious work for the developer to incorporate. Now a days, there are great tools that allow for ease of maintaining the coding standards of a project. These tools such as ESLint which points to where your linting errors occur or even the IntelliJ “Fix Lint on Save” allows for ease of allows your project to maintain those standards.</p>

<h2 id="agile-project-management">Agile Project Management</h2>
<p>I have been able to experience Agile Project Management within internships where you are creating tasks and working on them in Sprints. I think that this class was able to reinforce this learning environment which allowed me to get a more hands on and in-depth understanding of the process by allowing me to create the requirements as well as develop the project as well.</p>
